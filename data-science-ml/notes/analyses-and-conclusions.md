# Data Analyses and Conclusions

This module discusses five major kinds of data analyses. These analyses are:
1. Descriptive Analysis
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Inferential Analysis
4. Causal Analysis
5. Predictive Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis

From Codeacademy:
> Descriptive analysis lets us describe, summarize, and visualize data so that patterns can emerge.Sometimes we'll only do a descriptive analysis, but often we'll use it as a first step in our process.

Descriptive analyses usually include measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of dispersion.

Data visualization is also typically included in descriptive analysis.

## Exploratory Analysis

Typically after descriptive analysis, we move on to exploratory analysis. This is where we start to look for patterns and relationships in the data, more specifically, relationships between variables.

Again, exploratory analysis cannot tell us why these relationships exist, but it can help us to identify them. "Correlation does not imply causation."

### Clustering

Another technique used in exploratory analysis is clustering. Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that groups data points together based on their similarities.
