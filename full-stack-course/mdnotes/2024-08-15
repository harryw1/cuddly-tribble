# Objects

Now we're getting back to what I remember from CSII in college. Let's start by recapping
objects in general.

- Objects are non-primitive data types
- Objects are passed by reference
    - Passing by reference means we're point to 
    a location in memory
    - This means that objects are, essentially,
    always mutable
- Objects can store any data, for example:

```javascript
// Code snippet
const person = {
  height: "6 feet",
  weight: "160 pounds",
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "blue",
  bloodType: "O+"
};
```

This above code example abstracts the 'person' data structure into a set of 
key:value pairs and can be accessed with 'dot' notation or 'bracket' notation.

```javascript
console.log(person.height);
console.log(person.[hairColor]);
```
