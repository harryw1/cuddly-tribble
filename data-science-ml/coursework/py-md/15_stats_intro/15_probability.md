# Funamentals of Probability

This part of the course is based on probability since it is fundamental to data science. From Codeacademy:

> We’ll cover ways of calculating probabilities using formulas along with Python functions, how to visualize these random outcomes on a distribution, and how to represent a population using sample data.

## Why Probability?

Probability allows us to measure uncertainty and is essential in industries like meteorology, medicine, sports, insurance, etc.

## Outcomes

> At the end of this module, you will be able to:
> - Define probability using the law of large numbers
> - Quantify uncertain events using:
>   - The addition rule
>   - The product rule
>   - Bayes’ Theorem
>   - Tree Diagrams
> - Describe random events using probability distributions
> - Understand use-cases for the following probability distributions:
>   - Binomial Distribution
>   - Poisson Distribution
> - Describe a population using a sampling distribution and the central limit theorem

# Probability, Set Theory, and the Law of Large Numbers

Starting with set theory, this unit will cover the basics and foundational principles of probability.

## Set Theory

*Set Theory* is a branch of mathematics based around the concept of *sets*.
