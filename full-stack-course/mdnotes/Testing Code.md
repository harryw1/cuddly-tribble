# Unit Tests and Code Testing

Testing code is a crucial part of the software development process that helps ensure the reliability, functionality, and maintainability of applications. It involves writing and running automated tests to verify that individual components and the entire system behave as expected. Mocha, paired with assertion libraries like Chai, offers a flexible automated testing environment.

This unit covers testing code and some of the tools available to developers to do so.

## Why Test Code?

From Codeacademy:

>Software testing is the process of assessing the completeness and quality of computer software. Usually this is done by running a part of a system (like a web application) and comparing the actual behavior to the expected behavior. One way to perform software testing is manual testing. Manual testing is a form of testing done by a human interacting with a system. With web apps, this might be clicking, dragging, and typing through a webpage. A list of actions and expected behaviors would be given. If the observed behavior doesnâ€™t match the expected behavior, the application has an error.

## Manual Testing vs. Automated Testing

Manual testing is a time-consuming process that requires human intervention to execute test cases and verify the results. It is prone to errors and can be challenging to scale as the complexity of the software increases. Automated testing, on the other hand, involves writing scripts to run test cases automatically and compare the actual results with the expected results. It is faster, more reliable, and can be easily integrated into the development process.

## Types of Automated Tests

There are several types of automated tests that developers can use to test their code in order from cheapest and fastest to most expensive and slowest:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Test how different components work together to ensure they interact correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire system from end to end to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Testing Methodologies

There are several testing methodologies that developers can use to test their code:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before writing code to ensure that the code meets the requirements.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Write tests in a human-readable format to ensure that the code behaves as expected.
- **Specification by Example (SBE)**: Write tests based on real-world examples to ensure that the code meets the requirements.
- **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**: Write tests based on user stories to ensure that the code meets the requirements.

## Writing Tests with Mocha

Mocha is a popular testing framework for Node.js that provides a flexible and powerful testing environment. It supports various testing styles, including BDD and TDD, and integrates with assertion libraries like Chai to make writing tests easier.
