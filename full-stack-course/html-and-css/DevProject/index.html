    <h1>My First Rodeo</h1>
    <p>
      My first rodeo was a blast! I rode a bull named Thunder and lasted 8
      seconds. I was so proud of myself. I can't wait to do it again!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thunder was mean.</li>
      <li>Thunder was strong.</li>
      <li>Thunder was fast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I can't wait to ride Thunder again. I'm going to practice every day until
      I can ride him for 10 <a href="https://google.com">seconds</a>!
