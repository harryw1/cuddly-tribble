## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Features

- Responsive web design
- Semantic HTML
- CSS styling and layout techniques

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout these projects, I faced various challenges such as creating responsive layouts, using semantic HTML elements, and applying CSS styles effectively. Each project helped me improve my understanding of front-end development concepts and best practices.

## Future Work

After finishing the first module in the Full Stack Engineering path, I have learned the basics of HTML
and CSS. The next module is focused on the basics of JavaScript. By the end of this module, I should
be capable of creating more interactive webpages and understand the three major components of modern
webdev - HTML, CSS, and JS.
