## Descriptive Analysis

From Codeacademy:
> Descriptive analysis lets us describe, summarize, and visualize data so that patterns can emerge.Sometimes we'll only do a descriptive analysis, but often we'll use it as a first step in our process.

Descriptive analyses usually include measures of central tendency like mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of dispersion.

Data visualization is also typically included in descriptive analysis.
