## Course Progress

Since data science and machine learning are more relevant to the work I
conduct in my day to day job, I have stopped progress on the Full Stack
Development track to focus on the Data Science and Machine Learning track.
I am currently ~35% through the Data Science track and intend to complete
the course by early- to mid-2025.

## Topics Covered

### Data Science Track
- SQL basics and advanced queries
- Python programming
- Data analysis fundamentals
- Pandas and NumPy libraries
- Statistical concepts

### Full Stack Track
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation
- Responsive design
- Interactive web applications

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in both data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems in
sustainability science and environmental science
- Create practical projects to demonstrate skills
- Document learning progress
